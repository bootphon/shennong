### A Python toolbox for unsupervised speech recognition

* It aims to provide three blocks of processing as a **Python API**
  and a **command line interface**, inspired by the [Zero Resource
  Speech challenges](http://www.zerospeech.com):

  * **Speech features extraction**,
  * Subword modeling,
  * Spoken term discovery.

  Actually only speech features are implemented.
