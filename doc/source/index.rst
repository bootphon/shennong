Shennong's documentation
========================

* Shennong is a **toolbox for unsupervised speech recognition**.

* Provides a **Python API** and a **command line interface**.

* It aims to provide three blocks of processing, inspired by the
  results of the `zero resource speech challenge
  <http://www.zerospeech.com/>`_:

  * features extraction

  * subword modeling

  * term discovery

.. note::

   The package is still in development phase. Release *0.1* will
   include the *features* block, release 0.2 the *subword modeling*
   block, and release *0.3* the *term discovery* block. Further
   versions will include complete recipes, replication of published
   results and additional models.
